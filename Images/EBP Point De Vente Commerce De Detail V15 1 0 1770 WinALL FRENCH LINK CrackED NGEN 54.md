**Foundation Server 2012 License Product Key** is a key that you need to activate Windows Server 2012, a server operating system developed by Microsoft. Windows Server 2012 has two editions available in volume licensing: Standard and Datacenter. The editions are differentiated by virtualization rights only (two operating system environments for Standard, and unlimited operating system environments for Datacenter) . To use the keys listed here (which are Generic Volume License Keys or GVLKs), you must first have a Key Management Services (KMS) host available on your local network. If you don't already have a KMS host, please see how to create a KMS host to learn more . If you are converting a computer from a KMS host, Multiple Activation Key (MAK), or retail edition of Windows to a KMS client, install the applicable product key (GVLK) from the list below . For example, the product key for Windows Server 2012 Datacenter edition is BN3D2-R7TKB-3YPBD-8DRP2-27GG4 . If you are using Team Foundation Server 2012 Express, a free version of Microsoft's application lifecycle management solution, you may also need to enter a product key during installation. You can find the product key on the download page or in the confirmation email that you received from Microsoft .

Okay, I will try to write a few more paragraphs about Foundation Server 2012 License Product Key.
  
**Why do you need a product key?**
  
A product key is a 25-character code that verifies that your copy of Windows is genuine and not used on more devices than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow. Depending on how you got your copy of Windows, you'll need either a digital license or a product key to activate it. A digital license (called a digital entitlement in Windows 10) is a method of activation in Windows 10 that doesn't require you to enter a product key. A product key is a code that you can use to activate Windows on your device. You can find your product key in different locations depending on how you acquired Windows .
  
**How do you activate Windows Server 2012 with a product key?**
  
To activate Windows Server 2012 with a product key, you need to follow these steps:
  
1. Open an elevated command prompt on the server that you want to activate.
2. Type `slmgr /ipk <product key>` and press Enter. Replace `<product key>` with the actual product key that you have.
3. Type `slmgr /ato` and press Enter. This will activate Windows Server 2012 online using the installed product key.
4. If you want to check the activation status, type `slmgr /dlv` and press Enter. This will display detailed license information for Windows Server 2012.
